## Acknowledgments
- Many thanks to Cyfrin for their [Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/) and [Codehawks First flight](https://www.codehawks.com/first-flights) programs. The courses at Cyfrin Updraft and the first flights are amazing resources for learning solidity. More generally, the Codehawks platform provides a fantastic platform to go into competitive auditing. They come highly recommended.
