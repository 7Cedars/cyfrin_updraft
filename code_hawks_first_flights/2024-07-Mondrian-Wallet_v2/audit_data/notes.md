# About 
It is a straightforward abstracted account. Supposed to be able to interact with two different _system_ contracts. 

# notes
Three main topics are mentioned: 
- Account Abstraction => issues with signatures, role based access? 
- zkSync System Contracts => issue with calling these system contracts
- Upgradable smart contracts via UUPS 
  - issues with memory slots? - nope. There are no memory slots. 
  - Possible issue: upgrading is done via a system contract. (just as deploying contracts..) See https://docs.zksync.io/build/zksync-101/upgrading
  - Also.. what is the proxy?! the upgrade logic is completely off / bonkers. 
- Interacting with system contracts was an issue in zksync... right? Check. 
- Check if all system addresses are correct.
